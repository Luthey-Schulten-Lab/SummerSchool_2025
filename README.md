**Welcome to the STC-QCB Summer School 2025!**

These tutorials are part of the 2025 annual summer school ([Full program information here](https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/44/374882244.html)) organized by the NSF Science and Technology Center for Quantitative Cell Biology (STC-QCB) at UIUC.

### Schedule

In this computational study of the genetically minimized bacterium, JCVI-Syn3A, you will learn to:

1. Simulate the chromosome dynamics of Syn3A using LAMMPS  
2. Simulate coupled gene expression and metabolism of Syn3A with a spatially homogeneous whole-cell model (WCM) implemented by [**Lattice Microbe**](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/Lattice_Microbes)  
3. Analyze spatially heterogeneous trajectories from the 4DWCM (3D in space plus time) of Syn3A

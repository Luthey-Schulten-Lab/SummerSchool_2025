> [!WARNING]
Under Development

**Welcome to the STC-QCB Summer School 2025!**

These tutorials are one part of the 2025's annual summer school ([Full program information here](https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/44/374882244.html)) organized by NSF Science and Technology Center for Quantitative Cell Biology (STC-QCB) in UIUC.

### Schedule

In this computational study of genetically minimized bacterial, JCVI-Syn3A, you will learn:

1. Simulate the chromosome dynamics of Syn3A with LAMMPS
2. Simulate coupled gene expression and metabolism of Syn3A with a spatially homogenous whole-cell model (WCM) implemented by [**Lattice Microbe**](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/Lattice_Microbes)
3. Analyze the spatially heterogenous trajectories from 4DWCM (3D in space plus time) of Syn3A

1. [Delta User Help Document](https://docs.ncsa.illinois.edu/systems/delta/en/latest/): We will use **Delta**, one high-performace computing clusters sitted in National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), UIUC to conduct the computational tasks.
2. [Common Terminal Commands](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/cc180de0edee05075a6139e42d5f28ce): You need to know basic terminal commands to navigate the directories and launch jobs.
3. [Jupyter Notebook Basics](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/): Jupyter Notebook offers a user interface to run the simulation interactively.
4. [Try Jupyter Notebook Online](https://jupyter.org/try): Try it to get familiar with the interface.
5. [Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD)](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/): **VMD** as a versatile tool will be used to visualize the chromosome dynamics simulated by LAMMPS, and 4DWCM trajectories simulated by Lattice Microbe.
